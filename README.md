Middleware for data transport on Xilinx ZYNQ, MSc Thesis at TUC

The project consists of three parts:

  * Zynq-7000 hardware design (an UltraScale+ will come soon)
  * A Linux 4.x+ kernel driver
  * A user-space library (to be created)

Documentation is not here yet. You probably came here for this:
